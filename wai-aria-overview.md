# WAI-ARIA

- Provides a framework for adding attributes to identify features for user interaction, how they relate to each other, and their current state. 

- Describes navigation techniques to mark regions and common Web structures as menus, primary content, secondary content, banner information, and other types of Web structures.

- Defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. 
  
- Helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.
  
-  Without WAI-ARIA certain functionality used in Web sites is not available to some users with disabilities, especially **people who rely on screen readers and people who cannot use a mouse**.

## How to use

WAI-ARIA is supposed to be used when semantics are required to make a web application or widget understandable. 

For example, if you are using a <div> to create a checkbox, along with some scripting you can assign the WAI-ARIA role “checkbox” to that <div> to make it appear as a checkbox.

That said though, when there is a native HTML element available, like a checkbox, it is almost always better to use the native version than creating your own. 

For native HTML elements, it is not necessary to use WAI-ARIA.
