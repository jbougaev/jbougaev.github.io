# Examples of techniques to conform to adaptable guidline

Sighted users perceive structure and relationships through various visual cues:

- headings are often in a larger, bold font separated from paragraphs by blank lines; 
  
- list items are preceded by a bullet and perhaps indented; 
  
- paragraphs are separated by a blank line; 
  
- items that share a common characteristic are organized into tabular rows and columns; 
  
- form fields may be positioned as groups that share text labels; 
  
- a different background color may be used to indicate that several items are related to each other; 
  
- words that have special status are indicated by changing the font family and /or bolding, italicizing, or underlining them; 
  
- items that share a common characteristic are organized into a table where the relationship of cells sharing the same row or column and the relationship of each cell to its row and/or column header are necessary for understanding; 
  
- a chime might indicate the beginning of a new section; 
  
- a change in voice pitch or speech rate may be used to emphasize important information or to indicate quoted text;

- Some technologies do not provide a means to programmatically determine some types of information and relationships. In that case then there should be **a text description of the information and relationships**. For instance, "all required fields are marked with an asterisk (*)". 
  
Having these structures and these relationships programmatically determined or available in text ensures that information important for comprehension will **be perceivable to all**.

It is strongly encouraged that information and relationships **be programmatically determined rather than described in text**.
