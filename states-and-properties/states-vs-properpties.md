# States vs Properties

&nbsp;

"States" and "properties" are similar:

- Both provide specific information about an object.

- Both form part of the definition of the nature of roles. 

- Both are treated as aria-prefixed markup attributes. 


Differences: 

- The values of properties (such as aria-labelledby) are often less likely to change throughout the application life-cycle than the values of states (such as aria-checked) which may change frequently due to user interaction. 
  
**But** the frequency of change difference is not a rule; => most web content authors refer to both "states" and "properties" simply as "attributes" whenever possible.
