# Properties

&nbsp;

Attributes that are essential to the nature of a given object, or that represent a data value associated with the object. 

A change of a property may significantly impact the meaning or presentation of an object. 

Certain properties (for example, aria-multiline) are less likely to change than states, but note that the frequency of change difference is not a rule. A few properties, such as aria-activedescendant, aria-valuenow, and aria-valuetext are expected to change often.
